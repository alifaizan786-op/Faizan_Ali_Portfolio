                I have always wanted to be a developer, the only problem with that was I never got the chance to learn. For the most part I am a self thaught developer, atleast that's what i thought. In 2021, I completed my Coding Boot Camp From Georgia Tech and realised I hadn't even touched the surface of development, while self teaching myself. But now I can confidently say I am a result driven & skillful full-stack developer.
